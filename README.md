## Course Overview

This repository supports **Udacity's Programming Transformer Neural Networks with PyTorch** course, which is part of the **AI Programming with Python Nanodegree**. 

In this course, you will learn:

1. **Introduction to Transformer Neural Networks**  
   - Explore Transformer architecture and its applications, including ChatGPT.
   - Learn about NLP fundamentals such as tokenization and model training using PyTorch.

2. **Building Transformer Neural Networks with PyTorch**  
   - Implement a Transformer model using PyTorch.
   - Understand key components such as tokenization, embeddings, multi-head attention, training, and text generation.

3. **Using Pre-Trained Transformers**  
   - Learn how to fine-tune pre-trained Transformer models.
   - Explore their advantages, limitations, and applications to NLP tasks like text generation and question-answering.

By the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of how to build, train, and utilize Transformer-based models effectively in real-world applications.
